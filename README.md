# WebProject – Group 4 - 2019

This is the readme file of our Web Project which consists of creating a website for the students office of our engineering school.

### Prerequisites

-	Knowledge about web languages : HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/NODE [+ frameworks]
-	[UML Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) 

## Rules and outcomes

- Follow the school’s graphical chart
- Use datatables filled with Ajax for the back office
- No CMS allowed
- Two servers: one in Node.js, the other in PHP
- Different levels of rights, depending on the user

### Installing

To play our game you will have to download the multiple files of this subject.

To do this you can either download each file or enter this in your terminal :

```
git clone https://github.com/AntoineChvl/webProjectFinal.git
```

Then you’ll have to load the SQL script that you downloaded right before in phpMyAdmin. Then, you should run this command in your editor terminal:
```
Php artisan serve
```
This will create a web server and allows to access the website.

## Built With

* [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) – mySQL Database
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)- PHP Framework
* [PhPStorm]( https://www.jetbrains.com/)– PHP IDE

## Project review by authors


In the words of Vincent JACQUES
> Working on this project really help me to improve my knowledges about web development. Using these knowledges on the web site's creation was very interesting because we worked on something concrete.
I also learned how to work on a web project thanks to software such as phpstorm which we didn't see on the web block.
The reals issues I have met was on gitHub with some problems with differents versions.
Moreover, I whish I worked more on the back end of the web site cause it's the most interesting part of the web development.

In the words of Enzo LEBRUN
>  I enjoyed working on this project with the team. This week and a half has deepened our knowledge of website creation and organization using the laravel framework. But also, the use of last year's know-how adapted to our needs: I think of the realization of the database for our website.
We have encountered different problems that could be solved more easily than in previous projects.
Either way, we managed to organize ourselves thanks to the realization of the first folder "Conception" and also using "GitHub" for the sequel. Which allowed to lose as little time as possible and succeed in perform all the required tasks in addition to some bonuses.
Finally, I spoke with a friend, this project could have been done on the time of the block "Web". Which would have allowed to integrate, I guess,more easily the various notions. But also, to improve even more the current website to make it the most professional possible.

In the words of Tom Banchereau
> This project was very interesting in its globality.
I think that the time we had to do this project was a little bit too short,
I would have liked to improve even more our website
-use React.js on the shop to manage all the data and make a lot of filter
-create a live chat on each image 
First I was reticent with the fact that we were forced to follow a graphical chart, but my teammates did a great job.

In the words of Antoine CHAUVEL
> With a strong technical background, this project has been one of the most enriching yet. I truly appreciated to work on a concrete subject as this website was, in order to improve my programing languages knowledge during the last couple of weeks.
