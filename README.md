# WebProject – Group 4 - 2019

This is the readme file of our Web Project which consists of creating a website for the students office of our engineering school.

### Prerequisites

-	Knowledge about web languages : HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/NODE [+ frameworks]
-	[UML Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) 

## Rules and outcomes

- Follow the school’s graphical chart
- Use datatables filled with Ajax for the back office
- No CMS allowed
- Two servers: one in Node.js, the other in PHP
- Different levels of rights, depending on the user

### Installing

To play our game you will have to download the multiple files of this subject.

To do this you can either download each file or enter this in your terminal :

```
git clone https://github.com/AntoineChvl/webProjectFinal.git
```

Then you’ll have to load the SQL script that you downloaded right before in phpMyAdmin. Then, you should run this command in your editor terminal:
```
Php artisan serve
```
This will create a web server and allows to access the website.

## Built With

* [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) – mySQL Database
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)- PHP Framework
* [PhPStorm]( https://www.jetbrains.com/)– PHP IDE
